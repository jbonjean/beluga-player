Beluga Player is a simple Pandora (pandora.com) client developed for personal
use but other people may find it interesting so I decided to publish it.
This is still a work in progress, many features are missing, but it seems to be
pretty stable. It has only been tested on Linux 64 bits, that's why this is the
only package I release.

To start: java -jar beluga-VERSION-linux-x86_64.jar

Special thanks to:
 - Pandoroid project (http://aregner.com/android/pandoroid/), I reuse the
encryption part.
 - User Opals-On-Black.com on flickr
(http://www.flickr.com/photos/opals-on-black/) for his Beluga picture.
